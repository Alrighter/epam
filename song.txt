You were caught in a lie, said it with your eyes
Said to all my homies that you weren't even mine
You didn't think twice, got a heart made of ice
And that sh- hit me, did me dirty

I never asked why, and I never did cry
I never told another how I felt inside
Demons don't hide when I'm dreaming at night
And I won't mislead you, you'll miss me
